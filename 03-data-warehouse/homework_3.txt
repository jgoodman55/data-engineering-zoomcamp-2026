1. What is count of records for the 2024 Yellow Taxi Data?

CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS `data-engineering-module-03.ny_taxi`;

CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `data-engineering-module-03.ny_taxi.yellow_taxi_external`
OPTIONS (
  format = 'PARQUET',
  uris = ['gs://data-engineering-module-03-jgoodman/*.parquet']
);



SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM `data-engineering-module-03.ny_taxi.yellow_taxi_external`;

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `data-engineering-module-03.ny_taxi.yellow_taxi`
AS
SELECT *
FROM `data-engineering-module-03.ny_taxi.yellow_taxi_external`;

-- 20,332,093
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM `data-engineering-module-03.ny_taxi.yellow_taxi`;


2. Write a query to count the distinct number of PULocationIDs for the entire dataset on both the tables.

What is the estimated amount of data that will be read when this query is executed on the External Table and the Table?

-- 155.12 MB
SELECT
  count(distinct PULocationID)
FROM `data-engineering-module-03.ny_taxi.yellow_taxi`;

-- 0 MB
SELECT
  count(distinct PULocationID)
FROM `data-engineering-module-03.ny_taxi.yellow_taxi_external`;

3. Write a query to retrieve the PULocationID from the table (not the external table) in BigQuery. Now write a query to retrieve the PULocationID and DOLocationID on the same table.

Why are the estimated number of Bytes different?

SELECT
  PULocationID
FROM `data-engineering-module-03.ny_taxi.yellow_taxi`;

SELECT
  PULocationID, DOLocationID
FROM `data-engineering-module-03.ny_taxi.yellow_taxi`;

4. How many records have a fare_amount of 0?

-- 8333
SELECT
  count(1)
FROM `data-engineering-module-03.ny_taxi.yellow_taxi`
where fare_amount = 0;


5. What is the best strategy to make an optimized table in Big Query if your query will always filter based on tpep_dropoff_datetime and order the results by VendorID (Create a new table with this strategy)

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `data-engineering-module-03.ny_taxi.yellow_taxi_optimized`
PARTITION BY DATE(tpep_dropoff_datetime)
CLUSTER BY VendorID AS
SELECT *
FROM `data-engineering-module-03.ny_taxi.yellow_taxi`;


6. Write a query to retrieve the distinct VendorIDs between tpep_dropoff_datetime 2024-03-01 and 2024-03-15 (inclusive). Use the materialized table you created earlier in your from clause and note the estimated bytes. Now change the table in the from clause to the partitioned table you created for question 5 and note the estimated bytes processed. What are these values? (1 point)

-- 310.24 MB
SELECT
  distinct vendorid
FROM `data-engineering-module-03.ny_taxi.yellow_taxi`
where tpep_dropoff_datetime between '2024-03-01' and '2024-03-15';

-- 26.84 MB
SELECT
  distinct vendorid
FROM `data-engineering-module-03.ny_taxi.yellow_taxi_optimized`
where tpep_dropoff_datetime between '2024-03-01' and '2024-03-15';

7. Where is the data stored in the External Table you created?

GCS

8. It is best practice in Big Query to always cluster your data: (1 point)
False, depends on the data patterns

9. Write a `SELECT count(*)` query FROM the materialized table you created. How many bytes does it estimate will be read? Why? (not graded)

-- 0 MB
select count(*) from `data-engineering-module-03.ny_taxi.yellow_taxi`;

The count(*) only uses metadata to get the count of records, so it does not need to read the actual data.
